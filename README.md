Multiple Variable Linear Regression with a comparison between loop iteration and vectorized versions.

Steps:
- Give algorithm random parameters
- Cost function to gauge the extent of difference compared to the real value/price
- Gradient Descent used to alter the w and b parameters until it gives us a fairly accurate prediction
- Later, these final parameters can be used o predict the value/price for unknown values of features
